# Section 2.3: Chilling Units and Growing Degree Day Analysis

## Overview

This section analyzes chilling unit accumulation and growing degree day (GDD) patterns under different grow tube treatments during dormancy. The analysis integrates physiologically relevant chilling metrics from the cold hardiness model with traditional GDD calculations to assess how grow tube configurations influence dormancy satisfaction and spring heat accumulation across grape cultivars.

## Pipeline Structure

### Analysis and Visualization

**Script:** `1_chilling_gdd_analysis.r` - Performs statistical analysis and visualization of three thermal metrics

**Analysis Workflow:**

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**
   - Loads cold hardiness simulation results from Section 2.2
   - Calculates traditional GDD from daily temperature data
   - Extracts final cumulative values for each treatment-replicate combination

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - One-way ANOVA for each metric by cultivar
   - ANOVA assumption testing (Shapiro-Wilk, Levene's, Bartlett's)
   - Post-hoc comparisons using emmeans with Tukey adjustment
   - Compact letter displays when treatment effects are significant

**Thermal Metrics Analyzed:**
- **Ferguson DD Chilling** - Variety-specific chilling units from cold hardiness model
- **Ferguson DD Heating** - Variety-specific ecodormancy heat accumulation
- **Traditional GDD** - Standard GDD using base-10°C (pooled across varieties)

**Statistical Models:**
- Cultivar-specific metrics: `Metric ~ Treatment`
- Traditional GDD: Analyzed with varieties pooled

**Outputs:**
- `results_YYYY_YYYY_chill_gdd/Combined_CU_GDD_Analysis_Results_YYYY_YYYY.csv` - Statistical results
- `plots_YYYY_YYYY_chill_gdd/Chilling_GDD_Analysis_YYYY_YYYY.png` - Three-panel visualization

## Requirements

### R Environment
**Version:** R >= 4.0.0

**Required Packages:**
